I decided to create a site just because why not. I plan to write about my internet life story so far here, mostly about my projects, some drama, and more. The internet is a **wild** place, trust me. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Nix theme](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix) on steroids to achieve absolute perfection. I even stole some CSS from somewhere to animate a cool terminal text effect at the top. I'm not a very "bloggy" person so don't expect me to churn out tons of content. But anyway, catch you later. ;)
